# Beginner DFIR Lab – Autopsy & Wireshark

This repository documents a beginner-level Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) task
performed to understand how network activity can be correlated with disk artifacts.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Autopsy

## Task Overview
- Analyzed an offline PCAP file in Wireshark
- Identified suspicious DNS queries and HTTP GET requests
- Detected a suspicious file download from a fake software website
- Examined disk artifacts such as browser history and downloads using an Autopsy sample disk image
- Understood the concept of network-to-disk evidence correlation

## Key Learnings
- Basics of network forensics using Wireshark
- Understanding HTTP downloads and DNS resolution
- Introduction to disk forensics using Autopsy
- Importance of evidence correlation in DFIR investigations

## Safety Note
All analysis was performed using offline, publicly available practice datasets
in a controlled lab environment. No live traffic or real user data was involved.
